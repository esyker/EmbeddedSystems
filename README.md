# Weather Station

This project involves the creation of a weather station and is divided into two parts, where

### Part 1 Statement
***Check the project part 1 statement in Project_part1.pdf***

The requesites were the utilization of communication and synchronization mechanisms between tasks, in the context of concurrent applications, and should familiarize
with other embedded systems characteristics such as:
- access devices using simple digital input/output lines or network/buses such as I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit) or SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface);
- save information in non-volatile memory devices (EEPROM);
- utilization of analog-digital conversion;
- programming timers;
- use interrupts; 
- use of serial communication RS232;
- energy consumption, resorting to operation modes that will allow as much as possible to increase system autonomy;

### Part 2 Statement
***Check the project part 2 statement in Project_part2.pdf***

Part 2 involves using multitasking kernels for the development of concurrent applications in embedded systems. In particular, the utilization of communication and synchronization
mechanisms between tasks, in the context of concurrent applications. The multitasking kernel (operating system) to use will be eCos (Embedded Configurable Operating System), working on a PC
platform. It is developed communication interface between Part 1 (PIC board) and Part 2 (PC with eCos), using a
RS232 serial line.
